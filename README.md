As a senior at Rutgers University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with minors in Business Administration and Data Science, I have developed a strong foundation in software development, data analytics, and machine learning. My academic journey has been enriched by my participation in the Break Through Tech AI program at Cornell University, where I earned a certification in Machine Learning Foundations.

Professionally, I have gained hands-on experience through various roles, including my current position as an AI Studio Fellow at Google. Here, I am building a predictive model to optimize digital advertising strategies for promoting healthier alternatives to substance abuse.

In addition to my technical roles, I am passionate about education and mentorship. As a Learning Assistant at Rutgers, I lead recitation sessions for computer science students, helping them navigate complex concepts in programming and problem-solving. 

I am particularly interested in the intersection of technology, data science, and AI-driven solutions, and I am excited about future opportunities to apply my skills in these areas. Feel free to get in touch with me via email at shreya.narayanan@rutgers.edu
